## Understanding Gas Mileage

Using MTCARS we will be plotting to understand the relationship
of various factors to gas mileage

We will plot the following:
- We plot weight vs. mileage
-  the number of cylinders and the amount of horsepower as the size of an individual point in the plot.

## Visualizing the Data

```{r plot, echo=FALSE}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(plotly))
plot_ly(data = mtcars, x = ~wt, y = ~mpg, 
        color = ~as.factor(cyl), size = ~hp,
        text = ~paste("Weight: ", wt, '<br>MPG:', mpg),
        type = "scatter", mode = "markers") %>%
  layout(title = "Car Mileage Analysis")
```
